/**
 *VARIABLES
 * 
 *  Variables are containers for storing data and data values. They are named and can hold things like objects, arrays, functions, expressions, statements, numbers, 
 * booleans, strings, etc. The names of variables are called "identifiers". Identifiers are case sensitive. Below we'll detail declaring and assignment, var/let/const, and 
 * hoisting:
 * 
 * 0. DECLARATION AND ASSIGNMENT
 * 
 * To declare a variable you need to choose a key word. For a standard variable you would use the keyword "var", followed by the unique name of the variable,
 * and then an = operator. Lastly, to assign a value to your variable, you would add the value that you want to store in your new named container. 
 * Typically, a person would use camelCase where the first word is lowercase and the second word is capitalized like in the example below. 
 * If there is only one word then it should be lowercase. The variable value should always end in a semicolon. If there's no value, put the semicolon behind the name of the variable.
 * These are the steps to declaring and assigning a variable:
 * 
 *  var 
 *  var uniqueName
 *  var uniqueName =
 *  var uniqueName = true; //This declared variable has a value of true. If logged to the console (console.log(uniqueName)) the return will be the word "true".
